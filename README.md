# Text Classification, Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Cluster Analysis

Natural language processing (NLP) and cluster analysis of hotel reviews.

The dataset used for this project was the Hotel Reviews data provided by Datafinitiâ€™s Business Database (Kaggle, 2019). 

The objective of the analysis was to use text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to determine some insights into the reviews, as well as the sentiment (positive or negative) of patrons who stayed at the hotels, both on an overall level, but also at a specific province level for a few of the provinces in the dataset. More specifically, the purpose is to determine which hotels to recommend and which to avoid. 

A second analysis performed on the data is cluster analysis. Clustering of data occurs via mathematical algorithms that allow the hotels to understand what items within the data are similar to one another, therefore forming a cluster. Clustering also allows the hotel owners to understand what differs between the clusters (Han, Kamber, Pai, 2011).

This project involves using R to examine a dataset. The R script is included in the file "MasterGroupProjectwithAddendum.R". Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file. After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.

The full report can be found in the file "Natural Language Processing Assignment.pdf". This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, results, and interpretations. Tables and visualizations are also included.
