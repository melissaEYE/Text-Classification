# Text-Classification
The objective of the analysis was to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) of patrons who stayed at the hotels. The type of analysis is text classification. The goal of text classification is to extract features within the unstructured patron reviews that represent the hotels, concepts such as "I like" or "I don't like...."
